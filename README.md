# Assignment-1-Animation
TCSS 491 

In my team project, I was responsible for animating the player controlled units (knight, bandit, goblin, and samurai) and getting their controls functional. This is a stripped down version of the prototype that my group is submitting, but the core functionality remains intact. Units are still selectable, but for now, they are limited when it their animations. For now, we have strictly melee units working in the actual submission prototype. For assignment 1, I focused on animating a new ranged unit: the archer. This will act as a proof of concept.
